Summary of Assignment

In order to complete this assignment, I had to watch the tutorial videos multiple times. I found this assignment to be mentally draining and intimidating at first. The most challenging part for me was getting the content to center on the screen. I couldn't figure out why the code wasn't responding to the justify-content and justify-items commands. I had to re-enter those several times, walk away from my work, come back later, close the program, reopen it, and try again. Eventually, it worked, but it was very frustrating in the meantime.

Another challenging aspect was figuring out how to approach CSS grid from a responsive design perspective. Since I was intimidated by this assignment, I feel like I was overthinking it. I watched YouTube videos and instructor-led tutorials multiple times and finally managed to figure it out after several attempts.

By the time I completed the assignment, my eyes felt crossed and blurry. I checked my work at screen sizes of 1920px, 768px, and 414px to ensure it was responsive and resembled the mockups. By the end, I didn't trust my own eyes, so I had my significant other compare it to the mockups. He confirmed that it looked like the mockups.

Thank you for your time and instruction. It is greatly appreciated. I would have been lost without your detailed video and the additional videos included. Overall, I think that I'll love CSS Grid once I have more practive with it. I learned alot and applying the videos to a real life webpage was educational and beneficial to my growth.
